## Project Description
This project defines the concept of a common-knowledge network of authors in a research institution and uses it to identify communities of authors using a new heuristic algorithm for clustering editing problems on weighted similarity measure networks. 

This repository presents our approach to identifying and analyzing dominant research topics based on the most frequent keywords, publications, and collaboration incident counts for each identified research community. 

In addition to the code, this repository provides all clean and processed data (data.types) collected from the public domain that we used in this research project. 

## Dependencies
Maven dependency of [jGrapht](https://jgrapht.org/javadoc/) to add this project:

```
<groupId>org.jgrapht</groupId>
<artifactId>jgrapht-core</artifactId>
<version>1.5.2</version
```
### Quick Starts
This directory [src\mac\pubdata\ckn](src\mac\pubdata\ckn) all steps: from data collection to identification of research communities in a formulated common-knowledge network for a institute.
